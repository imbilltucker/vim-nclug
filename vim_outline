This is an outline of vim .. it should be something to peruse for things you've forgotten or want to practice.



* Windows
    - use :vnew to start a new vertical window
    - use :new to start a new horizontal window
    - use :vsplit to get a copy of current file
    - use :split to have horizontal split with copy of current file
    - use ctrl-w & a h,j,k,l direction to change window focus
    - use ctrl-w | or _ to widen the window with current focus
    - use ctrl-w = to equalize the window sizes

* Navigation
    - One letter:   h,j,k,l
    - One word: w,b   e, 
    - Paragraph: [,]
    - Page:
        - ctrl-d  move half a page down
        - ctrl-f  move page forward
        - ctrl-b  move page backward
    - ctrl-e  move up, leave cursor still
    - ctrl-y  move down, leave cursor still

* Editing
    - i insert mode before cursor, a insert mode after cursor
    - I insert mode at start of line, A insert mode at end of line
    - o insert new line below current line, enter insert mode
    - O insert new line above current line, enter insert mode
    - J combine next line with current line
    - dd delete current line
    - dw delete word
    - cw change word, delete current word, enter insert mode

* Dictionary, spelling
    - set spell    -- turn on highligting of spelling errors
    - set spell!   -- turn off
    - set nospell  -- turn off


* Managing packages
    - use pathogen: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

* Creating your own magic:  macros 
    - .vimrc is the file where all your settings take place and where you can place permanent 'shortcuts'
    - To permanently set a macro at the letter w, put this in your .vimrc
        let w='...', e.g. let w='0ibeginAend'  
        * if you have to use an escape, enter insert mode and <C-p> <escape> will insert the special escape character
    - instead of using a macro, this can be mapped to a leader key:
        map <leader>f 0ibegin<ESC>Aend
