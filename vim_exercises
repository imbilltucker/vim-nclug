There should be some vim exercies here.


* Buffer motion
    - Top of window
    - Bottom of Window
    - Current line to top of window
    - Keep cursor on current line, but move lines up by 3
    - Keep cursor on current line, but move lines down by 4


* Windows
    - create 4 panes in vim
    - switch focus to all of them
    - expand the northwest pane to fill the screen, then return to the 4 panes
    - expand the southeast pane to fill the screen, then return to the 4 panes
    ? which side of the screen does a new window get created on?   Is that what you want?
    ? What pattern of panes do you use in your normal workflow?  Ask why yourself should ever leave vim.

* Starting vim
    - Start vim with no .vimrc settings
    - Start vim in readonly mode

    - For *some_config.yml*, Change the date to the ides of March on each line.
        - Search and replace

        - Visual selection & Macro
         
    - For *list_of_tags.txt*, Change the uppercase numbers to lowercase, e.g. 'ONE' to 'one'
    - For *variables.js*, Comment out lines 5-10
    - For *variables.js*, Add semicolon to the end of every line.
