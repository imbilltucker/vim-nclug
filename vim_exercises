There should be some vim exercies here.

* Buffer motion
    - Top of window
    - Bottom of window
    - Middle of window
    - Current line to top of window
    - Scroll buffer down but leave cursor where it is
    - Scroll buffer up but leave cursor where it is

* Buffer management
    - Switch to previous buffer
    - List buffers
    - Switch to the 5th previous buffer
    - Switch to a buffer with a file name matching "hello_wor".
    - Save off session and buffer information

* Windows
    - create 4 panes in vim
    - switch focus to all of them
    - Expand one of the 4 to the full screen
    - Return to 4 panes
    ? which side of the screen does a new window get created on?   Is that what you want?
    ? What pattern of panes do you use in your normal workflow?  Ask why yourself should ever leave vim.

* Marks
    - Move to cursor position where mark "a" was placed
    - Move to line where mark "a" was placed
    - Start of last paste
    - End of last paste

    - Undo an undo.
    - Switch to how the buffer was 30 seconds ago.
    - List of change history.
