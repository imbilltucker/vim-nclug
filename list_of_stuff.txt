    Twelve drummers drumming, 
    Eleven pipers piping, 
    Ten lords a-leaping, 
    Nine ladies dancing, 
    Eight maids a-milking, 
    Seven swans a-swimming, 
    Six geese a-laying, 
    Five golden rings, 
    Four calling birds, 
    Three French hens, 
    Two turtle doves, 
    And a partridge in a pear tree!
